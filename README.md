# DnDesigner
This will ideally be a D&D 5E character builder and manager, similar to [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/), but with a way to import content from [5etools](https://5e.tools/). If we take it further, we might add ways to create custom content and share it with others. For a less ambitious goal, this will be a basic D&D characer builder and manager with options from the 5E SRD implemented.
